## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone or Download the Repository** : `https://github.com/hailedereje/simple-html-site.git`

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory** : `cd simple-html-site`

3. **Start a Local PHP Server**: 
    1. run this command `php -S localhost:{port} -t .` <<< I find this simple and more clean than setting up server using apache or running apache inside xammp 
    2. replace `port` with the port number you want to use

4. **Wait for Data Fetch** :
After starting the server, wait a little until the AJAX fetches the data.

5. **Access the Site**:
Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:{port}` (replace `{port}` with the port number you specified). You should see the site running with the search functionality enabled.
